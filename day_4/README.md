# Day 4 - Randomisation and Python Lists

I explored the random module and its applications, from generating random values to shuffling data. I also gained an understanding of Python lists, including appending items, handling index errors, and working with nested lists. The Rock Paper Scissors project strengthened my ability to integrate randomness into an interactive game.

Skills Learned:

- Using the random module

- List manipulation (appending, indexing, slicing)

- Handling index errors

- Nested lists
