# Day 5 - Python Loops

I delved into Python loops, particularly for loops and the range() function, to iterate over sequences effectively. These concepts were applied in my Password Generator project, where I developed a tool that creates secure passwords using randomization and looping techniques.

Skills Learned:

- for loops and iteration

- range() function usage

- Looping through lists

- Random password generation
