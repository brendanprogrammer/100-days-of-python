# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

On the first day, I learned the basics of Python, including printing to the console, string manipulation, debugging, and the input function. I explored how to create and use variables, follow proper naming conventions, and manage data efficiently. The project, a Band Name Generator, demonstrated my ability to manipulate user input and generate creative outputs dynamically.

Skills Learned:

- Printing and output functions

- String manipulation

- Debugging techniques

- User input handling

- Variable declaration and naming conventions
