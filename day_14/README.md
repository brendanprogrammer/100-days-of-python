# Day 14 - Higher Lower Game Project

Today, I practiced working with dictionaries, functions, and conditional statements by building the Higher Lower Game. The game challenges players to compare the popularity of different entities based on numerical values.

### Skills Learned:

- Using dictionary data structures
- Calling and structuring procedures
- Implementing conditional statements
- Developing a Higher Lower Game
