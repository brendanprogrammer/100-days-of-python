# Day 10 - Functions with Outputs

Today, I focused on writing functions that return values, handling multiple return values, using docstrings, and differentiating between print and return. My project, a Calculator, incorporated recursion and while loops to build a functional arithmetic calculator that can handle multiple operations efficiently.

Skills Learned:

- Functions with return values

- Multiple return statements

- Docstrings for documentation

- Recursion and while loops

- Difference between print and return
