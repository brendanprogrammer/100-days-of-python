# Day 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction

I gained proficiency in Python dictionaries and nesting lists within dictionaries. I applied these skills in the Secret Auction Program, which involved storing and managing user bids dynamically while applying logic to determine the winner.

Skills Learned:

- Dictionary creation and manipulation

- Nesting lists and dictionaries

- Handling dynamic user input

- Implementing auction logic
