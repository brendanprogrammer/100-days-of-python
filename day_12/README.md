Today, I explored the concepts of global and local scope, understanding how to modify global variables and use constants effectively. I applied these concepts in a Number Guessing Game, where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number.

### Skills Learned:

- Modifying global variables
- Understanding Python constants and global scope
- Implementing a Number Guessing Game
