# Day 7 - Hangman

I learned how to break down complex problems using flowcharts and improve user experience by checking user inputs effectively. The project involved building a Hangman game with ASCII art, allowing me to enhance the UI and gameplay while reinforcing my knowledge of loops and conditionals.

SKills Learned:

- Problem decomposition using flowcharts

- User input validation

- ASCII art integration

- Loops and conditionals in gameplay
