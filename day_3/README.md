# Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators

This day introduced me to control flow using if/else statements, logical operators, and the modulo operator. I learned how to create nested conditions and implement multiple conditions in succession. The Treasure Island project tested my ability to build an interactive decision-making adventure game using these fundamental programming concepts.

Skills Learned:

- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)

- Logical operators (and, or, not)

- Nested conditionals

- Modulo operator usage
