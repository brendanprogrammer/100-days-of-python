# Day 15 - Local Development Environment Setup & the Coffee Machine

Today, I focused on setting up a local Python development environment and applied my skills in building a Coffee Machine program. This project simulated a coffee vending machine, handling user inputs, inventory tracking, and transactions.

### Skills Learned:

- Installing and configuring Python locally
- Managing user interactions in a program
- Simulating a coffee vending machine with logic and conditionals
