# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

I focused on Python's primitive data types, type checking, and conversion techniques. I gained hands-on experience with mathematical operations, number manipulation, and the power of f-strings for formatted output. My project, a Tip Calculator, allowed me to apply these concepts practically by developing a tool for calculating tips and splitting bills.

Skills Learned:

- Data types and conversions

- Mathematical operations

- Type checking and error handling

- f-strings for formatting output
