# Day 11 - The Blackjack Capstone Project

Today, I focused on refining my skills in refactoring code, structuring procedures, and implementing game logic. My project, a Blackjack game, involved handling user decisions, calculating scores, and using loops to create an interactive gameplay experience.

### **Skills Learned:**

- Refactoring and optimizing code
- Structuring and calling procedures
- Implementing game logic for Blackjack
- Handling user inputs and decisions
- Using loops for game flow
